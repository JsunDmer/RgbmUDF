./build.sh is the command to build the hive udf jar

src contains gbm models and their udf wrappers
lib contains the output jar to be pushed to hadoop

the build dependency jars are contained in build.jars directory, its content can be refreshed when hadoop cluster is upgraded.
i.e., i created the current content by running the following bash command on hadoop
hadoop cli>export HDH=/home/vipshop/platform/hadoop/share/hadoop/common; export HVH=/home/vipshop/platform/hive; tar cvf build_jars.tar $HDH/*.jar $HDH/lib/*.jar $HVH/lib/*.jar

then transfer the build_jars.tar file (baniary mode) to the local build.jars directory with tar xvf
